# MAZE_RVRA

## Description
MAZE_RVRA is a Unity project that generates **procedural environments** using the **Wave Function Collapse (WFC)** algorithm. Each environment represents a different season (Winter, Spring, Fall), and users can **explore and interact** with objects to trigger environment changes, creating a continuous seasonal cycle.



## Features
- Procedural generation of seasonal environments using **WFC**.
- Interactive **VR/AR experience** with grab-able objects(Rose / Stump / Bush ).
- =**UI instructions** guiding the player’s actions through a UI screen.
- Automatic **environment regeneration** when the player interacts with objects.
- Continuous cycle of the 3 seasons: Winter → Spring → Fall → Winter.
